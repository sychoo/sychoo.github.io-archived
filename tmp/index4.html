		<p class="sect">Hi there, I'm Simon. I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkes-Barre,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Wilkes-Barre</a>, a small lovely city in Northeastern
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" target="_blank">PA</a>. It is a peaceful place where I can truly find myself. I love running along the Susquehanna River at the break of dawn or in the twilight. I enjoy
		<a href="https://github.com/sychoo" target="_blank">coding</a>, reading, or exploring the restaurants nearby.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="sect">I have been in the States for a while now (since August 2016). It has been an incredible experience for me. I have been to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoyuan" target="_blank">6 states </a> on the East Coast. I am a fan of Boston, Mac Computer, Camila Cabello, Taylor Swift, Harry Potter and <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank">Hexo</a>. </p>
		<br/>
		<p class="sect">I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Wilkes University. It has been my great pleasure to work with such brilliant people in my institute. </p>
		<br/>
		<p class="sect">Before WB, I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoyuan" target="_blank">Liaoyuan</a> with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoyuan" target="_blank">Mom and Dad</a>, the best parents I could ever ask for. </p>
